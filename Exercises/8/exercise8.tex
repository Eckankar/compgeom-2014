\section{Exercise 7.4}
We wish to show that the break points of the beach line, $B$, trace out the Voronoi diagram, $Vor(P)$.

\end{figure}

First we observe that each point in $B$ must be on the Voronoi diagram. We can
argue this by letting $b$ be such a break point. If the distance from $b$ to
the sweep line is $l$, then we must have that $p$ has distance $l$ to $b$, due
to $b$ being on its parabola. Likewise, $p'$ must also have distance $l$ to
$b$. As such, both points are equidistant to $b$. Since there are no
points closer to $b$ than $p$ and $p'$, % TODO: Overbevis mig om hvorfor?
we must have that $b$ is on the edge between $p$ and $p'$ in the Voronoi diagram.

We now observe that each point in $Vor(P)$ must be in $B$ for some position
of the sweep line. Let $v$ be a point from the Voronoi diagram, which has
distance $l$ to $p$ and $p'$. If we place the sweep line $l$ below $v$, we
will have that the parabola induced by $p$ will instersect the parabola
induced by $p'$ in $v$.
