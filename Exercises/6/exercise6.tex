\section{Exercise 7.1}

We can create such a set by placing one of the points $p_0$ as the
center of a circle, and placing the remaining points such that they
all have the same distance to $p_0$ and are evenly spaced around
$p_0$, in effect forming a circle around $p_0$. Since all the points
around $p_0$ have the same distance to $p_0$ and to their neighbors,
they will all share an edge with the cell containing $p_0$ in the
Voronoi diagram. As such, that cell will have exactly $n-1$ vertices.

\section{Exercise 7.3}
Assume we have $n$ numbers $x_1, \ldots, x_n$, and that we wish to sort these.

In $O(n)$ we find the minimal and maximal numbers, $x_{min}$
and $x_{max}$.

If we now normalize these points from $[x_{min} : x_{max}]$ to $[0 : \Pi]$, calling
$x_i$ normalized $x_i'$, we can now construct a 2-dimensional point-set.

Let $p_0 = (0,0)$, and let $p_i = (\cos(x_i'), \sin(x_i'))$. Each $x_i$ will
now correspond to a point on the unit circle. We now find a Voronoi diagram of
this point set, and wish to use this to find a sorted order for $x_1, \ldots,
x_n$.

If we look at $p_0$, it is equidistant to every other point, and thus its cell
will have an edge to each of them. Since the incident edges of a cell are
stored in cyclic order, it takes at $O(n)$ to transform this edge list to the
$x$'es in sorted order.

\section{Exercise 7.10}

We wish to find the two points of $P$ that are closest together.

We can determine the Voronoi diagram in $O(n \log n)$ time. The
Voronoi diagram contains at most $3n-6$ edges. Each edge connects two
faces, each containing one point, and by simply checking all such
edges to find the minimum distance between the two points they
connect, we can find the two points that are closest together. We know
that the faces containing the two points that are closest together
must share an edge, because otherwise there would be another point
somewhere in between, that is closer to the two points.
