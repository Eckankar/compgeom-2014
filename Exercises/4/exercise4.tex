\section{Exercise 6.5}

Given an convex polygon $\mathcal{P}$ as an array of its $n$ vertices
in sorted order around the boundary, we wish to decide in $O(\log n)$
time whether a query point $q$ is inside the polygon.

We do this by a recursive binary search. Find the point in the middle
of the array, and determine whether or not the angle $\angle p_1
p_{n/2} q$ is a left turn or a right turn. If it is a left turn,
recursively go into the left half of the array (still using $p_1$ as
the origin point) and similarly for right turns. If at some point we
only have three points (and thus a triangle), checking whether $q$ is
inside that triangle is a constant time operation. Since we always
half the amount of vertices in our array, we are guaranteed to reach
the base case at some point, and we only use $O(\log n)$ time.
