\section{Exercise 5.1}

We use the first rule of the master theorem~\cite{Cormen theorem 4.1}
to solve the recurrence. Since $a=2, b=4, f(n)=2$, we get that $\log_b a
= \frac{1}{2}$ and thus we get $Q(n) = \Theta(\sqrt{n})$.

Given that $Q(n) = \Theta(\sqrt{n})$, we also have $Q(n) = \Omega(\sqrt{n})$
as desired.

We can see an example of such a worst case by constructing a $m \times m$ grid
of evenly spaced points. It's easy to convince oneself that the splitting of
the plane done by the $kd$-tree will contain the lines of the grid.
\footnote{Minor tweaking of $x$ and $y$ coordinates is necessary to make
them distinct, but the idea should hold nonetheless.}

Let us then consider a query window starting above the grid, and ending below it,
placed such that it doesn't contain any points. (See \autoref{tegning-ex51})
This window will intersect at least $m$ lines, and overlap with at least $m+1$
regions. If we let $n = m^2$, we get $\sqrt{n}+1$ regions we must check, and
as such is an example of the worst case.

\section{Exercise 5.10}

\subsection{Exercise 5.10a}

We can easily modify the 1-dimensional range tree to accommodate range
counting queries by letting each node store an integer that indicates
how many leaves that node's subtree contains. Then, querying becomes a
simple matter of finding the nodes which we'd normally call
\verb+ReportSubtree+ on (reporting all their children) and instead
simply report how many leaves are in that sub-tree.

Proving that this modified 1-dimensional range tree lets us query for
range counts in $O(\log n)$ time, is a simple matter of recalling that
the query time for normal range queries in a 1-dimensional range tree
is $O(\log n + k)$, where the $k$ is the time spent in calls to
\verb+ReportSubtree+. In our range counting queries, we have
substituted the calls to \verb+ReportSubtree+ for a constant time
operation (reporting the number stored in the node), and it thus
follows that the query time must be $O(\log n + 1) = O(\log n)$.

\subsection{Exercise 5.10b}

By simply using the modified 1-dimensional range tree from exercise
5.10a in the construction of a d-dimensional range tree, we can query
for range counts analogously to how we did it in exercise 5.10a. From
the proof for theorem 5.9, we get that the query time is $O(\log^d n +
k)$, where $k$ is the time taken to report points. But instead of
reporting points, we are reporting the counts stored in the root of
each sub tree, which takes constant time. Thus, the query time for
d-dimensional range count queries using our modified d-dimensional is
$O(\log^d n)$.

\subsection{Exercise 5.10c}

In the $d$-dimensional range tree, using fractional cascading on the last
dimension, we recall that once we find the split node, we perform a binary
search to find the smallest coordinate within our range.

We choose to also, at this point, do a binary search to find the smallest
coordinate above our range.

We then follow the pointers stored in these spots into the subtrees we
examine, as in the regular range query, but instead of iterating through the
elements, we simply calculate the amount of nodes that would be reported as an
offset of the positions in the array. Doing so gives $\log n$ $O(1)$ operations
instead of the $O(k)$ reporting time. This gives a total query time of $O(\log n)$
instead of $O(\log n + k)$ on the $2$-dimensional case, giving a total query time
of $O(\log^{d-1}n)$ in the $d$-dimensional case.
